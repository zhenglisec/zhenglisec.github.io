abstract: >-
  Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved significant success in the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL) for visual recognition. The image encoder pre-trained through MIM, involving the masking and subsequent reconstruction of input images, attains state-of-the-art performance in various downstream vision tasks. However, most existing works focus on improving the performance of this http URL this work, we take a different angle by studying the pre-training data privacy of MIM. Specifically, we propose the first membership inference attack against image encoders pre-trained by MIM, ...
