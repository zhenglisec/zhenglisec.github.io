abstract: >-
  Machine learning models are prone to memorizing sensitive data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to infer whether an input sample was used to train the model. Over the past few years, researchers have produced many membership inference attacks and defenses. However, these attacks and defenses employ a variety of strategies and are conducted in different models and datasets. The lack of comprehensive benchmark, however, means we do not understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing attacks and defenses. ...
