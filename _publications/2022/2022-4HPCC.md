abstract: >-
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in various fields. Despite their spectacular advances, DNNs are known to suffer from adversarial vulnerabilities. The robustness of DNNs is then threatened by leading them to misclassifications with unexpected inputs (adversarial examples). The fuzzing technique frequently used for testing traditional software has recently been adopted to evaluate the robustness of DNNs. Current DNN fuzzing techniques focus on image classification DNNs and generate test cases by mutations, e.g., image transformations and adversarial perturbations. However, mutation-based test cases usually lack diversity and have distribution deflection from the original DNN input space, which impacts the evaluation of DNNs. ...
