  Machine learning (ML) has made huge progress in the last decade and has been applied to a wide range of critical applications. However, driven by the increasing adoption of machine learning models, the significance of privacy risks has become more crucial than ever. These risks can be classified into two categories depending on the role played by ML models: one in which the models themselves are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information, and the other in which the models are abused to violate privacy. In this dissertation, we investigate the privacy risks of machine learning models from two perspectives, i.e., the vulnerability of ML models and the abuse of ML models. To study the vulnerability of ML models to privacy risks, we conduct two studies on one of the most severe privacy attacks against ML models, namely the membership inference attack (MIA). Firstly, we explore membership leakage in label-only exposure of ML models. We present the first label-only membership inference attack and reveal that membership leakage is more severe than previously shown. Secondly, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks through the lens of membership leakage. We leverage existing attack methodologies to quantify the vulnerability of multi-exit networks to membership inference attacks and propose a hybrid attack that exploits the exit information to improve the attack performance. From the perspective of abusing ML models to violate privacy, we focus on deepfake face manipulation that can create visual misinformation. We propose the first defense system \system against GAN-based face manipulation by jeopardizing the process of GAN inversion, which is an essential step for subsequent face manipulation. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the privacy risks of machine learning models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the in-depth investigation of privacy risks, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving machine learning techniques.
