abstract: >-
  The availability and accessibility of diffusion models (DMs) have significantly increased in recent years, making them a popular tool for analyzing and predicting the spread of information, behaviors, or phenomena through a population. Particularly, text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., DALLE 2 and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and perform various image synthesis tasks. Despite their widespread adoption in many fields, DMs are often susceptible to various intellectual property violations. These can include not only copyright infringement but also more subtle forms of misappropriation, such as unauthorized use or modification of the model. Therefore, DM owners must be aware of these potential risks and take appropriate steps to protect their models. In this work, we are the first to protect the intellectual property of DMs. We propose a simple but effective watermarking scheme that injects the watermark into the DMs and can be verified by the pre-defined prompts. In particular, we propose two different watermarking methods, namely NAIVEWM and FIXEDWM. The NAIVEWM method injects the watermark into the LDMs and activates it using a prompt containing the watermark. On the other hand, the FIXEDWM is considered more advanced and stealthy compared to the NAIVEWM, as it can only activate the watermark when using a prompt containing a trigger in a fixed position. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of both approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness in watermark injection and verification with minimal impact on the LDM's functionality.
