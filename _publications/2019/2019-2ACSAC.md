abstract: >-
  Deep learning techniques have made tremendous progress in a variety of challenging tasks, such as image recognition and machine translation, during the past decade. Training deep neural networks is computationally expensive and requires both human and intellectual resources. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the intellectual property of the model and externally verify the ownership of the model. However, previous studies either fail to defend against the evasion attack or have not explicitly dealt with fraudulent claims of ownership by adversaries. Furthermore, they can not establish a clear association between the model and the creator's identity. ...
