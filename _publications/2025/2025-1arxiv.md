  The rapid advancement of generative models has led to the proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for detection methods to generalize across diverse and evolving generative techniques. Existing approaches often fail to adapt to unknown models without costly retraining, limiting their practicability. To fill this gap, we propose Post-hoc Distribution Alignment (PDA), a novel approach for the generalizable detection for AI-generated images. The key idea is to use the known generative model to regenerate undifferentiated test images. ...
