  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation. It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from non-member-retrieved documents. ...
