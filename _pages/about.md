I am a full professor at [School of Cyber Science and Technology, Shandong University](https://cst.qd.sdu.edu.cn/). 

Previously, I was a postdoc at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), supervised by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). In Oct 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), supervised by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). I received my bachelor (2017) and master (2020) degrees from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Shanqing Guo](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/guoshanqing/zh_CN/index.htm).


## Research Interests

My research centers on Trustworthy Machine Learning (Privacy, Security, and Safety), especially analyzing machine learning model vulnerabilities, including privacy attacks (MIA and AIA), backdoors, and data poison attacks. Additionally, I work on technical solutions against unethical AI systems.
